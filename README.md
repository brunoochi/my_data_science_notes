# My Data Science Notes
Find here samples of the kind of work/task I do as a Data Analyst/Scientist

- [Project Flat](PJ_Flat): webscraped average rent prices from a Japanese real estate portal, performed some geoprocessing usind QGIS, and visualized the data using the folium library in Python   
- [Project Resolution](PJ_Resolution): used a dataset containing United Nations General Assembly resolutions to practice data wrangling with pandas and K-means clustering
- [Project K](PJ_K): used LastFM API to extract data of top K-pop albums and Twitter API to find and extract timeline data of artists. Processed both data to build two datasets that were merged and visualized in Tableau
- [Project Matcha](PJ_Matcha): extracted data from several PDFs using the pdfplumber library and performed quick exploratory analysis on the number of applicants and test takers of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)
- [Project Car](PJ_Car): predicted used car prices using decision tree, random forest, and linear regression. This project was a refresher of essential machine learning techniques.
- [Project Battle](PJ_Battle): this project uses basic natural language processing techniques to perform EDA, sentiment, and topic analysis on customer reviews of two well known video games franchises - Battlefield and Call of Duty.
