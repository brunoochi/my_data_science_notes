# PJ Matcha
In this project, I test pdfplumber - a Python library that extracts data from PDF - to extract the number of applications and the number of test takers of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. The data is stored in several PDFs that compiles information from all test centers around the world from the period of 2010 to 2019.

After testing the library and performing the data extraction, I conduct a quick analysis using Matplotlib and Tableau. Which location has the highest number of applicants? How is the demand of Japanese language education growing over time? What are the the areas of growth / decline? These are some of the questions that I intend to address using this data.
