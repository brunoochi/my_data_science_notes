# My Data Science Notes
Find here samples of the kind of work/task I do as a Data Analyst/Scientist

- [Project Flat](PJ_Flat): webscraped average rent prices from a Japanese real estate portal, performed some geoprocessing usind QGIS, and visualized the data using the folium library in Python   
- [Project Resolution](PJ_Resolution): used a dataset containing United Nations General Assembly resolutions to practice data wrangling with pandas and K-means clustering with scikit-learn
- [Project K](PJ_K): used LastFM API to extract data of top K-pop albums and Twitter API to find and extract timeline data from top performers. Processed both data to build two datasets that were merged and visualized in Tableau
