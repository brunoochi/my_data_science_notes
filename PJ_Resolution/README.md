# PJ Resolution
The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is the forum of debate where 193 nations convene to discuss world affairs and vote resolutions that shape international law and politics.
<p>
In this project, I use UNGA resolution data to understand voting patterns. I expect to see something that goes more or less along the lines of well known alliances such as the group of rich nations (G7), oil-rich countries (OPEC), and former soviet countries being clustered together. Will these blocs really emerge as we expect?
  
Project work was done over a weekend and the idea was to practice data preparation and tentatively run a clustering algorithm.
